# Javass
First Year Java Project @ EPFL (CS_108 course): Jass Game

by Raoul Gerber

Create a Jass (Swiss card game) game using Java.

### Launch the game
The files are those of the Eclipse project, it is thus recommended to open the workspace in Eclipse.
To start the game, first run RemoteMain, then run LocalMain. This will instantiate two instances of the game for two players to play.
